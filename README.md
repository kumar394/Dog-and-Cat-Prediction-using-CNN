# Dog-and-Cat-Prediction-using-CNN
Built a CNN deep learning model to train on 8000 images of dogs and cats and predicted on 2000 images. I tried to predict random pics from internet and the result is outstanding. It can further be improved using increasing number of epochs and adding dropout regularization.
